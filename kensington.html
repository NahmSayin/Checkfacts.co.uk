          A: In 2016 there were an estimated 6.1 million incidents of crime experienced by adults in England and Wales. Almost every police force in the country recorded an increase in crime, with worrying rises in some of the most violent offences, including gun and knife crime and homicide. Under the Conservatives police numbers have been cut substantially. Cuts to the police force endanger communities and endanger police officers too.
         </p>

          <p>
          Emma&#39;s party will recruit 10,000 more police officers to work on community beats, equivalent to at least one more for every neighbourhood in the country. Furthermore, they will strengthen the law, banning the use of community resolutions as a response to domestic violence. Emma&#39;s party&#39;s approach to crime will be different.[3]

          <p>The deficit is down to &pound;24.7bn from a high of &pound;154bn in 2009/10 following years of Labour mismanagement.</p>

          A: The primary duty of any government is to protect and defend its citizens. The last Labour government consistently spent above the NATO benchmark of 2 per cent of GDP. Conservative spending cuts have put Britain&#39;s security at risk, shrinking the army to its smallest size since the Napoleonic wars. The scrapping of Nimrod, HMS Ark Royal and the Harrier jump-jets have weakened our defences and cost British taxpayers millions. Emma&#39;s party has a commitment to spending at least 2 per cent of GDP on defence will guarantee that our Armed Forces have the necessary capabilities to fulfil the full range of obligations, and ensure our conventional forces are versatile and able to deploy in a range of roles. Labour supports the renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent.[3]

          A: &ldquo;Our  world  is  full  of  opportunity  but  is  also  riven  by  conflict,  terrorism  and  threat.  As a global power, we have a responsibility to sustain our fine armed forces so that they can  defend  the  realm,  our  overseas  territories  and  our  interests  around  the  globe.  We  will  play  a  leading  role  in  NATO  and  maintain  the  ability  to  conduct  strike  operations,  peacekeeping, security missions and the deployment of a joint expeditionary force. We will  maintain  the  overall  size  of  the  armed  forces,  including  an  army  that  is  capable  of  fielding  a  war-fighting  division.  We  shall  expand  our  reach  around  the  world.  We  will  retain the Trident continuous-at-sea nuclear deterrent to provide the ultimate guarantee of our security.We have the biggest defence budget in Europe and the second largest in NATO. We will continue to meet the NATO commitment to spend at least 2 per cent of GDP on defence and we will increase the defence budget by at least 0.5 per cent above inflation in every year of the new parliament.&rdquo; [10]

As Conservatives, we  are  committed  to  leaving  the  environment  in  better  condition  than  we  inherited  it.  That is why we will continue to take a lead in global action against climate change, as the government  demonstrated  by  ratifying  the  Paris  Agreement.  We  were  the  first  country  to  introduce  a  Climate  Change  Act,  which  Conservatives  helped  to  frame,  and  we  are  halfway  towards  meeting  our  2050  goal  of  reducing  emissions  by  eighty  per  cent  from  1990 levels.We   will   champion   greater   conservation   co-operation   within   international   bodies,   protecting  rare  species,  the  polar  regions  and  international  waters.  We  will  work  with  our  Overseas  Territory  governments  to  create  a  Blue  Belt  of  marine  protection  in  their  precious waters, establishing the largest marine sanctuaries anywhere in the world.&rdquo;
